This is a placeholder PNG file for the architecture diagram.

To generate a real diagram:

1. Open docs/architecture.md
2. Render the Mermaid diagram in a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid (e.g. VS Code with Markdown Preview Mermaid Support, or GitHub pages)
3. Export the rendered diagram as PNG
4. Replace this placeholder file with the exported PNG, keeping the same filename: docs/architecture.png
